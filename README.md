# 🌱 AI-Powered ESG Reporting Platform

An **AI-augmented ESG reporting platform** that combines deterministic ESG calculations with **grounded AI copilots** to deliver **audit-ready, CSRD-aligned sustainability reporting**.

This project demonstrates how **AI can responsibly augment ESG reporting** by improving narrative generation, audit explainability, and decision intelligence—without hallucinations or black-box logic.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This platform is built around **four core principles**:

1. **Audit-first design** – ESG data treated with the same rigor as financial data  
2. **Explainability over black-box AI** – AI outputs are grounded, transparent, and defensible  
3. **Progressive CSRD readiness** – Supports staged maturity rather than unrealistic “instant compliance”  
4. **Decision intelligence, not dashboards** – ESG insights are connected to financial and risk outcomes

## 📄 Regulatory Disclaimer

This platform is designed to support **enterprise ESG reporting, CSRD readiness, and audit preparation**.

While it provides structured ESG calculations, audit intelligence, and AI-assisted disclosures, **final regulatory compliance, legal sign-off, and external assurance remain the responsibility of the reporting organization and its appointed auditors**, as required under CSRD.

This aligns with standard practice across enterprise ESG and compliance software.
